# Skylar Scott

## Introduction

I have a BS in physics from UNM, and have worked as a benchtop scientist, data analyst, 
equipment technician, and design advisor in R&D for the past decade. 
Currently, I am attending CNM Deep Dive to turn my coding and data analysis experience 
into a much more broadly applicable software engineering skillset.

I intend to seek employment in the software industry after graduation.
